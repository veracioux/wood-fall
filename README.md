# Wood Fall

This is a really old project I made in high school for fun.

**NOTE:** Wood Fall is no longer on Google Play because they have been updating
their privacy policy and I haven't had the time to keep up. You can download it
as an APK file in [Releases](https://github.com/HarisGusic/wood-fall/releases).
